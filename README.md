# FitbitOAuth2Example
This example was developed for students as part of a class I taught CS2212 at the University of Western Ontario. It uses a version of the scribejava package which includes the addition of a fitbit implementation. It demonstrates the use of a localhost servlet for authentication, as well as a resource pull example
